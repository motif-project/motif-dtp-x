# motif-dtp-x

motif-dtp-x is an experimental sandbox for exploring and prototyping Delegated Traded Positions (DTP) issuance designs for the Motif protocol. This repository serves as a space to conceptualize, test, and iterate on innovative mechanisms for creating and managing DTPs, leveraging Bitcoin-backed security through Bitcoin Pods and the EigenLayer AVS architecture.

## üöÄ Overview

Motif‚Äôs DTPs allow BTC liquidity providers to create tradable tokens representing reward-bearing strategies secured by Bitcoin Pods. The motif-dtp-x repo focuses on:
	-	Designing and testing DTP issuance models
	-	Prototyping interactions between DTPs, Bitcoin Pods, and AVS
	-	Evaluating collateral management and token minting processes
